   <div><pre style="color: black; margin-top: 5%;" class="kerala">
       Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. 
       Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries.
       Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad; 
       backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; 
       and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam, Silent Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park.
       The "backwaters" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Vembanad Lake, also see heavy tourist traffic.
       Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. 
       To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007.
       Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.
       The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population.
       Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people.
       The state has also made deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at Kochi.</pre>
